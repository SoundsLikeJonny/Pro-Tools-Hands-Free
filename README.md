# Pro Tools Hands-Free
Control Pro Tools with your voice! A simple applet that uses voice commands to emulate key commands on Mac OS and control Pro Tools UI elements 

> Note: You can use the script to work with another DAW if you wish. Just change the 'tell' blocks to work with your DAW's UI Elements

## Getting Started
Move the .app file into your applications folder

> Note: Upon launching the applet, you will come accross some screens that ask for permission to use the microphone, System Events, and the Apple Speech Recognition server.

Here is the first prompt for a voice command!

Notice the microphone on the right? Clicking 'show' will allow you to see the available commands at the current point of execution of the program.

> Note: Make sure Pro Tools is the active window. Some commands mimic keystrokes and can cause unwanted results if another program is the active window. This includes this application! It's best to click 'show' on the microhphone to see what voice commands are available while in Pro Tools

## The 'freeze' Command
'Freeze' will cause the program to stop listening until you say 'keep listening'

## Say 'Finished' when done
Saying 'finished' will end the program

> Note: You may notice that the microphone sticks around for a while after the program closes, but it will eventually go away.  

## Close the Applet Without Voice By Using 'Force Quit'

Currently there is no other way to close the program without the 'finished' voice command
