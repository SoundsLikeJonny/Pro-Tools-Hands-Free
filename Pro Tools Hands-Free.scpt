--	This script uses the Apple Speech Recognition Server to listen for speach patterns comparing them to a 
--	list of key words. It then uses the keyword to determine what to Pro Tools UI element to click
--
--	This script uses an Apple application called "System Events" that requires authorization
--	prior to use. You will be prompted multiple times throughout your first use to accept 
--	system accessibilty attributes
